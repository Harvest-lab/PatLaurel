            Pat laurel Schools was established in 2009 starting with only Pat laurel Nursery and Primary School, Lagos. In 2012, 
            Pat laurel Secondary School was estalblished, some of our parents have been clamouring for the establishment of a secondary 
            school to enable their wards continue to benefit from the role model building programme of the school. 
            Little wonder then that many of the pioneer students of the High School were products of the Primary School. The trend continues 
            till date.
